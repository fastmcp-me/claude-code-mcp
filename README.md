# claude-code-mcp Project


## [0.1.5] - 2025-06-24

### Security Update
- Update @anthropic-ai/claude-code version.

## Overview

The claude-code-mcp project is an MCP server for Claude Code.

It calls the locally installed Claude Code command and provides the following tools: `explain_code`, `review_code`, `fix_code`, `edit_code`, `test_code`, `simulate_command`, and `your_own_query`. The server is implemented using Node.js and the MCP SDK, receiving JSON format requests from clients via stdio. Internally, it adopts Base64 encoding to smoothly process special characters (newlines, quotation marks, etc.) in natural language text, resulting in improved stability and flexibility. Its main roles are receiving requests, encoding input, generating and executing commands, and returning execution results in JSON format.
This project has been confirmed to work in Claude Code CLI environments (Ubuntu/WSL2, etc.).

MCP Host with less capable LLM, can tame and make use of Claude powerðŸ’ª!
With claude-code-mcp, you can also call Claude Code from Claude Desktop!! ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜œðŸ˜Ž (unconfirmed)

## Functions

The main roles of the server are:

-   **Request Reception:** Receive JSON format tool requests from clients (e.g. `code`, `context`, `focus_areas`, etc.).
-   **Input Processing:** Internally Base64 encode the received natural language text.
-   **Tool Selection and Command Generation:** Based on the tool name in the request, assemble a command string for the query using a fixed template or free format (`your_own_query`).
-   **Command Execution:** Use Node.js's `child_process.spawn` to execute the assembled command and get the result from standard output.
-   **Result Return:** Return the execution result to the client in JSON format.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (>= v18 recommended, tested with v22.14.0)
-   npm (or yarn)
-   Claude Code command installed and auth completed.

### Installation & Usage

There are several ways to use `claude-code-mcp`:

**1. Using npx (Recommended for quick use)**

You can run the server directly without installation using `npx`:

```bash
npx @kunihiros/claude-code-mcp
```

**2. Global Installation**

Install the package globally:

```bash
npm install -g claude-code-mcp
```

Then, you can run it as a command:

```bash
claude-code-mcp
```

**3. Local Installation (For development)**

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KunihiroS/claude-code-mcp.git
cd claude-code-mcp/claude-code-server
npm install
npm run build
```
You can then run the built script directly:
```bash
node build/index.js
```

### Configuration

**Environment Variables:**

Regardless of the installation method, you need to configure the environment variables. Create **one** of the following files:

1.  **Using MCP Host Settings (Recommended for `npx`):** Configure environment variables directly within your MCP Host's settings (see "MCP Host Configuration" below). This is the easiest way when using `npx`.
2.  **Using a `.env` file:** Create a `.env` file in the directory where you run the `npx @kunihiros/claude-code-mcp` command.
3.  **Using a global config file:** Create a `.claude-code-mcp.env` file in your home directory (`~/.claude-code-mcp.env`).

If using a file (`.env` or `~/.claude-code-mcp.env`), add the following content, adjusting the `CLAUDE_BIN` path:

```dotenv
# .env or ~/.claude-code-mcp.env
CLAUDE_BIN=/path/to/your/claude/executable  # REQUIRED: Set the full path to your Claude CLI
LOG_LEVEL=info                             # Optional: Set log level (e.g., debug, info, warn, error)
```

**MCP Host Configuration (Recommended for `npx`):**

Add the following to your MCP Host application settings (e.g., Claude Desktop settings). This method allows you to set environment variables directly.

```json
    "claude-code-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@kunihiros/claude-code-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "CLAUDE_BIN": "/path/to/your/claude/executable", // REQUIRED: Set the absolute path
        "LOG_LEVEL": "info"                             // Optional: Set log level
      },
      "disabled": false
    }
```
*(Restarting the host application might be required.)*

**Alternative MCP Host Configuration (Global Install / Local Dev):**

If you installed the package globally or are running it locally from the cloned repository, and the `claude-code-mcp` command is in your system's PATH, you can use:

```json
    "claude-code-server": {
      "command": "claude-code-mcp",
      "disabled": false
    }
```
In this case, you **must** configure environment variables using a `.env` file or the global `~/.claude-code-mcp.env` file as described above.

## Environment Variables Details

This server uses the following environment variables (set via MCP Host `env` settings, `.env`, or `~/.claude-code-mcp.env`):

-   `CLAUDE_BIN`: Specifies the path to the Claude CLI executable. **(Required)**
    Example: `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/claude` or `C:\Users\YourUser\AppData\Local\bin\claude.exe`
-   `LOG_LEVEL`: Specifies the log level. (Optional, defaults to `info`). Possible values: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`.

## Available Tools

The `claude-code-mcp` server provides the following tools:

- `explain_code`: Provides a detailed explanation of the given code.
- `review_code`: Reviews the given code.
- `fix_code`: Fixes bugs or issues in the given code.
- `edit_code`: Edits the given code based on instructions.
- `test_code`: Generates tests for the given code.
- `simulate_command`: Simulates the execution of a given command.
- `your_own_query`: Sends a custom query with context.

## Note

- Log file (`claude-code-mcp.log`) location:
    - Attempts to create in the project root first.
    - Falls back to the user's home directory (`~/.claude-code-mcp.log`).
    - Finally falls back to `/tmp/claude-code-mcp.log`.
- Log rotation is not implemented yet (be careful with log file size).
- Primarily tested with Claude CLI on Ubuntu/WSL2.
